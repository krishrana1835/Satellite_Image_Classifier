# Satellite_Image_Classifier
A Python-based image classification model that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify satellite images into four categories: cloudy, desert, water, and forest. The model is trained on labeled satellite image data and leverages deep learning techniques for accurate environmental classification.
