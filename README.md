# Satellite_Image_Classifier
A Python-based image classification model that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify satellite images into four categories: cloudy, desert, water, and forest. The model is trained on labeled satellite image data and leverages deep learning techniques for accurate environmental classification.

Key Features:
-  Built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras
-  Image preprocessing and augmentation
-  CNN model architecture for image classification
-  Training and evaluation scripts
-  Easily extendable for additional classes or datasets
